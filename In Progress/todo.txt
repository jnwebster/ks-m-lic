history!
	Millenia ago, the people of the land were constantly at war with themselves and each other, a very wise woman formulated a course that would set the world on the path of peace.
	Her name was Crab. She wasn't literally a crab, that was her name. She was a person like you and me, just very wise.
	She unified the land and established great peace. Her followers recorded her wisdom, housing it in temples across the land and passing it down through the centuries.
	Eventually, her wisdom was all but forgotten, the temples were abandoned, and the people lost their way.
	There was a brief resurgence in popularity many years ago, but since most of the writings had been lost, they actually thought she *was* a crab, and erected statues and houses of learning in her honor in the shapes of crabs.
	But once again, the people in general have lost the guiding widsom of the great and wise Crab.
	Perhaps it is time for the great Crab's wisdom to shine once again.


	
temples (0/9)
	have dark/light temples only open when the 6 elemental gems are gathered AND tasked with gathering black/white
	have cosmos temple only open w/ dark/light AND when tasked with gathering magenta
	first round temples (6) are super easy (nonexistant/basic platforming, nonexistant/basic puzzles, maybe no enemies?)
	second round temples (2) are easy (basic/moderate platforming, basic/moderate puzzles, a couple of enemies?)
	third round temple (1) is medium (moderate/tricky platforming, moderate/tricky puzzles, light enemies)

warp
	maybe?
	once a gem is collected, can warp from hero tower to its temple's entrance, but not the other way? both ways?

draw a map
	5 cutscenes, each centered on an east/west row but show the row north/south

bonus spots: tiny little spots hidden throughout the world, each with a loyal follower dispensing a tidbit of wisdom (TBD)
	how many?
	approach should be tricky (medium difficulty as compared with the primary game's easy difficulty)
	should only require "basic" powerups to reach
	should give wisdom in sequence, no matter which one is found first, should dispense wisdom #0, etc
